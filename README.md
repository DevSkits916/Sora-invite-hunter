# Sora Invite Code Hunter
https://sora-invite-hunter-v3xc.onrender.com
Sora Invite Code Hunter is a lightweight Flask application that continuously scans Reddit for potential Sora invite codes and presents the latest findings in a friendly dashboard and JSON feed. A background worker polls Reddit's public search API, extracts candidate codes with a strict pattern, and keeps a deduplicated in-memory list for quick monitoring.

## Features

- üîÅ Background polling thread with configurable interval and search query
- üîé Regex-based extraction of 5‚Äì8 character alpha-numeric codes that contain at least one digit
- üß† In-memory deduplication with thread-safe access
- üåê Clean HTML dashboard and JSON API for integrations
- üåç Polls Reddit searches, targeted subreddits, and proxied X/Twitter live feeds for fresh leads
- ‚öôÔ∏è Runtime configuration through environment variables
- ü©∫ Production-ready `/healthz` endpoint and automatic source cooldowns for Render health checks

## Quick Start

### Run locally

1. **Create a virtual environment** (Python 3.11+ recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Launch the app**:
   ```bash
   python sora_hunt.py
   ```
4. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard.

### Deploy to Render

Render supports Docker- and native-based deploys. This project is configured for a native Python deploy using [`render.yaml`](render.yaml).

#### One-time setup

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Sign in to [Render](https://render.com) and click **New + ‚Üí Web Service**.
3. Connect your GitHub account, pick the forked repository, and choose the branch to deploy from.
4. When prompted, Render will auto-detect `render.yaml`. Confirm the settings or select **Use Render.yaml** if prompted.

Render will provision a service using the configuration below:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime | Native Python |
| Build Command | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Start Command | `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT sora_hunt:create_app()` |
| Python Version | `3.11.6` |
| Health Check Path | `/healthz` |

The service uses the environment variables defined in [`render.yaml`](render.yaml). Update the defaults or add new variables in Render's dashboard after the first deploy.

#### Redeploys & updates

1. Push changes to the branch Render is tracking (or open a PR and merge it).
2. Render automatically rebuilds using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and restarts the service with Gunicorn.
3. Monitor logs under **Events** to confirm the background polling thread is running.

#### Custom configuration

Override any environment variable under **Environment ‚Üí Environment Variables** in the Render dashboard. The service restarts automatically to pick up the new settings.

## Configuration

Use environment variables to adjust runtime behavior without changing code:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `60` | Seconds between Reddit polling cycles (minimum enforced: 10 seconds). |
| `MAX_POSTS` | `75` | Maximum number of Reddit search results to inspect per poll (clamped to 1‚Äì100). |
| `QUERY` | `Sora invite code OR 'Sora 2 invite' OR 'Sora2 invite'` | Reddit search query string. |
| `USER_AGENT` | `sora-hunter/0.1` | User-Agent header sent to Reddit's API. |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port the Flask app listens on when run directly. |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address when running the Flask development server. |
| `DISABLE_SOURCES` | _(unset)_ | Optional comma-separated list of source names to disable (case-insensitive). |

Set variables inline when launching:

```bash
POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30 QUERY="Sora invite" python sora_hunt.py
```

The background worker automatically pauses individual sources after consecutive failures and resumes them once the cooldown ends. Use `DISABLE_SOURCES` to keep problematic providers disabled permanently (for example, when a site begins blocking automated queries).

### Data Sources

Each polling cycle collects potential codes from a mix of sources:

- The configurable Reddit search query (default: `Sora invite code OR 'Sora 2 invite' OR 'Sora2 invite'`).
- A focused Reddit search for "Sora invite code" plus an additional "Sora beta code" query.
- The newest posts from `/r/ChatGPT`, `/r/OpenAI`, and `/r/SoraAI`.
- Live X/Twitter searches for both `Sora invite code` and the `#SoraInvite` hashtag, proxied through [r.jina.ai](https://r.jina.ai/) to retrieve text content without authentication.

Adding an invite code in any of these places will quickly surface on the dashboard once the next poll completes.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/` | Human-friendly HTML table showing the newest candidate codes first. |
| `GET` | `/codes.json` | JSON payload containing configuration snapshot, last poll timestamp, and candidate list. |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | Health check endpoint used by Render to verify the worker thread is alive. |

## Candidate Data Model

Each candidate entry returned by `/codes.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "code": "S0RA1",
  "example_text": "... excerpt from the Reddit post ...",
  "source_title": "Post title containing the code",
  "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/example/comments/abc123/example",
  "discovered_at": "2024-04-10T12:34:56.789123+00:00"
}
```

The list is deduplicated by `code` and ordered newest-first when served.

## Suggested Monitoring Sources

To maximize coverage when hunting for new Sora invite codes, monitor the following
channels alongside the app's automated Reddit polling:

### Official / Semi-Official Surfaces
- [OpenAI‚Äôs official Sora site](https://sora.com) ‚Äî codes occasionally appear inside the app flow.
- App Store "Sora" listing ‚Äî check release notes and invite instructions.
- OpenAI Help Center and blog posts ‚Äî access instructions are sometimes announced here.

### Community Channels (fastest but noisier)
- Reddit communities such as [r/OpenAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/), [r/ChatGPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/), and [r/Artificial](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/) where dedicated megathreads and community chatter surface codes quickly.
- X/Twitter ‚Äî search for "Sora 2 invite code" and filter to the latest posts.
- Discord servers in AI-focused communities (e.g., "AI Exchange" or "Prompt Engineering Hub") that maintain `#sora-invites` channels.

### Watchdog / Archival Sources
- Archived invite code lists (Pastebin, GitHub gists, or similar links shared in AI communities).
- Tech media coverage from outlets like TechCrunch, The Verge, or Ars Technica that may describe distribution methods during rollout phases.
